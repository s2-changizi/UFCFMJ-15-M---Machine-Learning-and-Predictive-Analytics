**Predictive Modelling for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms**

**Introduction**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually. Early detection and timely medical intervention are crucial to improve survival rates and quality of life. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on a dataset of patient health indicators.



**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Cardiovascular Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, available on Kaggle. It contains 70,000 records of patient data with 12 attributes, including demographic information, health status indicators, and lifestyle choices.



**Project Workflow**



- Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data distribution, visualizing patterns and relationships.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones to improve model performance.
- Model Selection: Evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best predictive model.
- Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
- Results and Discussion: Analyzing the results and discussing the implications for healthcare.



**Results**



Based on the results, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and LDA showed the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, making them suitable choices for predicting cardiovascular disease.
